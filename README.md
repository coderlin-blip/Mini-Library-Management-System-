# Mini Library Management System

### **Project Overview**

The Library Management System is a Python-based application that manages **books and member records** for a library.
It allows adding books, registering members, borrowing books, and returning them.
The system is built to demonstrate **modular programming**, **data validation**, and **basic file structure organization** in Python.
